# Scripts Directory

This directory contains entry point scripts for training and backtesting.

## Purpose

- Training scripts (train.py, train_ppo.py, etc.)
- Backtesting scripts
- Data preprocessing scripts
- Evaluation scripts

## Notes

- Scripts should be runnable from command line
- Use argparse or click for command-line arguments
- Import core logic from other modules (envs, models)
- Keep scripts focused on orchestration, not implementation
