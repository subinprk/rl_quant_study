# Models Directory

This directory contains neural network architectures and policy definitions for reinforcement learning agents.

## Purpose

- Define neural network architectures (CNN, LSTM, Transformer, etc.)
- Policy network definitions
- Value network definitions
- Actor-Critic architectures

## Notes

- Keep model definitions separate from training logic
- Document input/output shapes and architecture choices
