# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for analysis and visualization only.

## Purpose

- Data exploration and visualization
- Results analysis
- Performance evaluation
- Visualization of trading strategies

## Important

**No core logic should be implemented in notebooks.**

All reusable code should be in proper Python modules under:
- `envs/` for environments
- `models/` for model definitions
- `scripts/` for training/backtesting

Notebooks are for analysis and experimentation only.
